## Thank you for your interest in contributing!
To contribute is quite simple, just keep in mind the content you want to add to the repository and set up a structure that makes everyone understand, and of course, a C++ implementation.

## Steps
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a subfolder in the category of your content
3. In this subfolder, must be present the following files:
```
/your-subfolder
  - README.md
  - main.cpp
  - any-other-cpp-file-if-need.cpp
  
The README.md is the main file, where you will explain the content that you know and want to share. And the main.cpp is the implementation of the content using C++. If you need more than one file to explain, you can create, no problems.
```
4. Once you have done, add the files to track using `git add .`
5. And commit it using `git commit -m "add: me awesome content"`
6. Send the pull request
7. Done!
